 # To run a multiple linear regression predicting casual rentals:
 # Convert the normalized celsius temperature (which was divided by a max of 41)
 # to unnormalized degrees F
 bike$tempF = (bike$temp*41)*(9/5)+32

 # Try a quadratic term on temperature. Center variables first.
 bike$tempFcentered = bike$tempF - mean(bike$tempF)
 bike$tempsquared=bike$tempFcentered^2



 model = lm(casual ~ windspeed+hum+tempFcentered+tempsquared+workingday+mnth+yr,data=bike)
 summary(model)


 # So the quadratic is significant and the vertex of that quadratic graph
 # (where the effect of temperature flattens and begins to decline)
 # happens at -b/2a = 16 degrees (of centered data)
 # Thus, since the mean is almost 69 degrees, the decline in demand happens when
 # temperatures reach 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
